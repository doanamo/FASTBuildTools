FASTBuild Tools Extension
==========
VSIX extensions that workarounds or provides helpers for some usability issues when working with FASTBuild projects from Visual Studio IDE. This is still heavily work in progress and for now is intended to be used with FASTBuild projects generated by Sharpmake.

Features:
* **DebugBuildProject** - Command for building NMake projects that execute FBuild.exe prior to debugging. If executed on regular non-FASTBuild project based on MSBuild, it falls back to regular debug command that is by default bound to F5.
* **CompileSingleFile** (Work in Progress) - Command for building single file from FASTBuild solution, similarly to default Ctrl+F7 that does not work with non MSBuild based projects.
